# Cart-Pole Deep Q Network (DQN)
* Open AI GYM's cart-pole env is solved using Policy Gradient algorithm. Certain metrics and variables are logged to Tensorboard. Goal is to experiment with hyperparameters and to gain experience tuning them.

## Run:
```bash
$ python dqn_pytorch_tutorial.py
```
* To visualize using Tensorboard:
    ```bash
        $ tensorboard --logdir logs
    ```
